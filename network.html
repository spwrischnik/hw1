                       Computer Networks are what allows us to connect to the internet. There are 7 steps that data goes through to transfer
                       from device to device. This is called the OSI Model. Some terms related to networking are switches, modems, routers, ip address,
                       mac address, and dhcp. 
                   </p>
                   <h2> Networking Definitions </h2>
                   <li><span class = "term">Switch</span>: Hardware that connects up to 48 devices to the internet through packet switching. </li>
                   <li><span class = "term">Modem</span>: Device that acts as a bridge between the internet and a local network. </li>
                   <li><span class = "term">Router</span>: Connects multiple networks and routes network traffic between them. </li>
                   <li><span class = "term">IP Address</span>: Stands for Internet Protocol address. This address is assigned to a device on a network to 
                   allow it access to the internet. This address can be configured manually or automatically. </li>
                   <li><span class = "term">MAC Address</span>: Stands for Media Access Control address. This is a unique address given to every device 
                   that has a network card installed inside. </li>
                   <li><span class = "term">DHCP</span>: Stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. This allows devices to be given IP addresses 
                   automatically. </li>
